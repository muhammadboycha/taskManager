# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### Custom Notes about the application

1. The application and functionality
   This application is developed by using React js and Javascript.
   It has some features like
   1. Creating a task
   2. Updating task priority
   3. Updating task status
   4. Deleting task.
   5. Searching and sorting the tasks.
   6. When I click the task title it will open a popup and we will see task details.
2. The setup and launch process
   1. I create this application using "npx create-react-app" and for staring "npm start"
   2. If you clone this repository run "npm i" and then run "npm start". It will run the app in localhost:3000.
3. Any assumptions made during development.
   1. I assume user account is already created and user is already login.
   2. I assume localstorage as database.
   3. I use "Clear all data" button as logout and clear the data.
   4. I use context API to store the data and save the current state into localstorage.
   5. I create couple of branch and commit the changes and raise PR to master branch.
4. Attach screenshot of the projcet.
   1. I have added couple of screenshot in the "Application screenshot" directory in the root directory of the application. (file names start with "Screenshot\_").
5. Github repository link.
   1. https://github.com/muhammadboycha/taskManager.git
6. For testing the application. It is hosted in Netlify. You can run and test the application in this URL.
